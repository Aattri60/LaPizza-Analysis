# LaPizza-Analysis
**Introduction**
This SQL project for a pizza store aims to analyze sales and ordering patterns to gain actionable insights. Key objectives include retrieving the total number of orders placed and calculating total revenue from pizza sales. We will identify the highest-priced pizza and the most common pizza size ordered to understand customer preferences. The project will list the top 5 most ordered pizza types and their quantities, and join necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered. We will analyze the distribution of orders by hour to identify peak times and determine the category-wise distribution of pizzas. By grouping orders by date, we will calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day. Additionally, we will identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue and calculate the percentage contribution of each type to total revenue. The analysis will include tracking cumulative revenue over time and determining the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each category. Utilizing SQL, this project will provide the pizza store with valuable insights to optimize operations and improve market strategies.
